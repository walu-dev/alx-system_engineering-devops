WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TYPE WWW.GOOGLE.COM IN YOUR BROWSER AND HIT ENTER

After typing the url eg. www.goole.com which contains the domain name, the server with the help of a Domain Name System(DNS) sever translates the domain name into Internet Protocol(IP) address as severs communicate with IP address. The sever searches for the IP address in the DNS cache of the browser. A TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) connection between the two severs is established through a three way handshake. After a connection is established both sides know that that the other side exists and are trying to communicate with each other. A Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) request is sent from the application server which the server of your machine to a google server and google responds with HTTP response which contains the Hypertext Markup Language(HTML) for Google's homepage
